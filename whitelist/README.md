# Whitelist contract for staking pools

The purpose of this contract is to maintain the whitelist of the staking pool contracts account IDs that are approved
by NEAR Foundation.

In order for the lockup contracts to be able delegate to a staking pool, the staking pool should faithfully implement the spec.
The staking pool should guarantee that the delegated tokens can not be lost or locked, such as the lockup contract should be
able to recover delegated tokens back to the lockup from a staking pool. In order to enforce this, only approved (whitelisted)
accounts of staking pool contracts can receive delegated tokens from lockup contracts.

If NEAR Foundation has to approve every single staking pool account it might lead to a bottleneck and centralization.
To address this NEAR Foundation can whitelist the account IDs of staking pool factory contracts.

The whitelisted staking pool factory contract will be able to whitelist accounts of staking pool contracts.
A factory contract creates and initializes a staking pool contract in a secure and permissionless way.
This allows anyone on the network to be able to create a staking pool contract for themselves without needing approval from the NEAR
Foundation. This is important to maintain the decentralization of the decision making and network governance.

To be able to address mistakes, NEAR Foundation has the ability to remove staking pools and staking pool factories from the whitelists.

## Requirements and guarantees

- The account of the whitelist contract should not contain any access keys, to avoid it from being deleted.
- If the account runs out of tokens for storage, any account can fund it. In theory the gas rebates may cover the storage in the long term.
- `is_whitelisted` call doesn't panic, unless it's given insufficient amount of gas or the invalid account ID.
- The contract maintains two separate whitelists, one for staking pools and one for factories.

## API

The methods are split into Getters (view methods), the method that can be called by both an approved factory and the foundation,
and methods that can only be called by the foundation.

## Changelog

### `0.2.0`

- Internally updated to use `LookupSet` instead of `UnorderedSet`.
