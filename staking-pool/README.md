# Staking / Delegation contract

This contract provides a way for other users to delegate funds to a single validation node.

Implements the https://github.com/nearprotocol/NEPs/pull/27 standard.

There are three different roles:
- The staking pool contract account `my_validator`. A key-less account with the contract that pools funds.
- The owner of the staking contract `owner`. Owner runs the validator node on behalf of the staking pool account.
- Delegator accounts `user1`, `user2`, etc. Accounts that want to stake their funds with the pool.

The owner can setup such contract and validate on behalf of this contract in their node.
Any other user can send their tokens to the contract, which will be pooled together and increase the total stake.
These users accrue rewards (subtracted fees set by the owner).
Then they can unstake and withdraw their balance after some unlocking period.

## Staking pool implementation details

For secure operation of the staking pool, the contract should not have any access keys.
Otherwise the contract account may issue a transaction that can violate the contract guarantees.

After users deposit tokens to the contract, they can stake some or all of them to receive "stake" shares.
The price of a "stake" share can be defined as the total amount of staked tokens divided by the the total amount of "stake" shares.
The number of "stake" shares is always less than the number of the staked tokens, so the price of single "stake" share is not less than `1`.

### Initialization

A contract has to be initialized with the following parameters:
- `owner_id` - `string` the account ID of the contract owner. This account will be able to call owner-only methods. E.g. `owner`
- `stake_public_key` - `string` the initial public key that will be used for staking on behalf of the contract's account in base58 ED25519 curve. E.g. `KuTCtARNzxZQ3YvXDeLjx83FDqxv2SdQTSbiq876zR7`
- `reward_fee_fraction` - `json serialized object` the initial value of the fraction of the reward that the owner charges delegators for running the node.
The fraction is defined by the numerator and denumerator with `u32` types. E.g. `{numerator: 10, denominator: 100}` defines `10%` reward fee.
The fraction can be at most `1`. The denumerator can't be `0`.

During the initialization the contract checks validity of the input and initializes the contract.
The contract shouldn't have locked balance during the initialization.

At the initialization the contract allocates one trillion yocto NEAR tokens towards "stake" share price guarantees.
This fund is later used to adjust the the amount of staked and unstaked tokens due to rounding error.
For each stake and unstake action, the contract may spend at most 1 yocto NEAR from this fund (implicitly).

The current total balance (except for the "stake" share price guarantee amount) is converted to shares and will be staked (after the next action).
This balance can never be unstaked or withdrawn from the contract.
It's used to maintain the minimum number of shares, as well as help pay for the potentially growing contract storage.

### Delegator accounts

The contract maintains account information per delegator associated with the hash of the delegator's account ID.

The information contains:
- Unstaked balance of the account.
- Number of "stake" shares.
- The minimum epoch height when the unstaked balance can be withdrawn. Initially zero.

A delegator can do the following actions:

#### Deposit

When a delegator account first deposits funds to the contract, the internal account is created and credited with the
attached amount of unstaked tokens.

#### Stake

When an account wants to stake a given amount, the contract calculates the number of "stake" shares (`num_shares`) and the actual rounded stake amount (`amount`).
The unstaked balance of the account is decreased by `amount`, the number of "stake" shares of the account is increased by `num_shares`.
The contract increases the total number of staked tokens and the total number of "stake" shares. Then the contract restakes.

#### Unstake

When an account wants to unstake a given amount, the contract calculates the number of "stake" shares needed (`num_shares`) and
the actual required rounded unstake amount (`amount`). It's calculated based on the current total price of "stake" shares.
The unstaked balance of the account is increased by `amount`, the number of "stake" shares of the account is decreased by `num_shares`.
The minimum epoch height when the account can withdraw is set to the current epoch height increased by `4`.
The contract decreases the total number of staked tokens and the total number of "stake" shares. Then the contract restakes.

#### Withdraw

When an account wants to withdraw, the contract checks the minimum epoch height of this account and checks the amount.
Then sends the transfer and decreases the unstaked balance of the account.

#### Ping

Calls the internal function to distribute rewards if the blockchain epoch switched. The contract will restake in this case.

### Reward distribution

Before every action the contract calls method `internal_ping`.
This method distributes rewards towards active delegators when the blockchain epoch switches.
The rewards might be given due to staking and also because the contract earns gas fee rebates for every function call.

The method first checks that the current epoch is different from the last epoch, and if it's not changed exits the method.

The reward are computed the following way. The contract keeps track of the last known total account balance.
This balance consist of the initial contract balance, and all delegator account balances (including the owner) and all accumulated rewards.
(Validation rewards are added automatically at the beginning of the epoch, while contract execution gas rebates are added after each transaction)

When the method is called the contract uses the current total account balance (without attached deposit) and the subtracts the last total account balance.
The difference is the total reward that has to be distributed.

The fraction of the reward is awarded to the contract owner. The fraction is configurable by the owner, but can't exceed 1.

The remaining part of the reward is added to the total staked balance. This action increases the price of each "stake" share without
changing the amount of "stake" shares owned by different accounts. Which is effectively distributing the reward based on the number of shares.

The owner's reward is converted into "stake" shares at the new price and added to the owner's account.
It's done similarly to `stake` method but without debiting the unstaked balance of owner's account.

Once the rewards are distributed the contract remembers the new total balance.

## Owner-only methods

Contract owner can do the following:
- Change public staking key. This action restakes with the new key.
- Change reward fee fraction.
- Vote on behalf of the pool. This is needed for the NEAR chain governence, and can be discussed in the following NEP: https://github.com/nearprotocol/NEPs/pull/62

## Staking pool contract guarantees and invariants

This staking pool implementation guarantees the required properties of the staking pool standard:

- The contract can't lose or lock tokens of users.
- If a user deposited X, the user should be able to withdraw at least X.
- If a user successfully staked X, the user can unstake at least X.
- The contract should not lock unstaked funds for longer than 4 epochs after unstake action.

It also has inner invariants:

- The staking pool contract is secure if it doesn't have any access keys.
- The price of a "stake" is always at least `1`.
- The price of a "stake" share never decreases.
- The reward fee is a fraction be from `0` to `1` inclusive.
- The owner can't withdraw funds from other delegators.
- The owner can't delete the staking pool account.


## Pre-requisites

To develop Rust contracts you would need to:
* Install [Rustup](https://rustup.rs/):
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```
* Add wasm target to your toolchain:
```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

## Building the contract

```bash
./build.sh
```

## Usage

Commands to deploy and initialize a staking contract:

```bash
near create_account my_validator --masterAccount=owner
near deploy --accountId=my_validator --wasmFile=res/staking_pool.wasm
# Initialize staking pool at account `my_validator` for the owner account ID `owner`, given staking pool and 10% reward fee.
near call my_validator new '{"owner_id": "owner", "stake_public_key": "CE3QAXyVLeScmY9YeEyR3Tw9yXfjBPzFLzroTranYtVb", "reward_fee_fraction": {"numerator": 10, "denominator": 100}}' --account_id owner
# TODO: Delete all access keys from the `my_validator` account
```

As a user, to delegate money:

```bash
near call my_validator deposit '{}' --accountId user1 --amount 100
near call my_validator stake '{"amount": "100000000000000000000000000"}' --accountId user1
```

To update current rewards:

```bash
near call my_validator ping '{}' --accountId user1
```

View methods:

```bash
# User1 total balance
near view my_validator get_account_total_balance '{"account_id": "user1"}'

# User1 staked balance
near view my_validator get_account_staked_balance '{"account_id": "user1"}'

# User1 unstaked balance
near view my_validator get_account_unstaked_balance '{"account_id": "user1"}'

# Whether user1 can withdraw now
near view my_validator is_account_unstaked_balance_available '{"account_id": "user1"}'

# Total staked balance of the entire pool
near view my_validator get_total_staked_balance '{}'

# Owner of the staking pool
near view my_validator get_owner_id '{}'

# Current reward fee
near view my_validator get_reward_fee_fraction '{}'

# Owners balance
near view my_validator get_account_total_balance '{"account_id": "owner"}'

# Staking key
near view my_validator get_staking_key '{}'
```

To un-delegate, first run `unstake`:

```bash
near call my_validator unstake '{"amount": "100000000000000000000000000"}' --accountId user1
```

And after 3 epochs, run `withdraw`:

```bash
near call my_validator withdraw '{"amount": "100000000000000000000000000"}' --accountId user1
```
